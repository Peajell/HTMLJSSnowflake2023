            <p>Hi I'm marcos i enjoy tinkering and exploring new things like software and hardware
            hardware like computer repair classes got me into I.T . I used to volunteer at a library where i helped students 
            and people learn to thinker with their devices, like opening pc's showing them the parts like the motherboard the cpu, and how to proper install components 
            a tricky one would be the thermal paste. How to clean them and just make it fun for the library.
